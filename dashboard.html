<h3>Graph captions</h3>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;For Non-Hispanic White and Non-Hispanic Asian, the greatest number of people who died from COVID-19 were in the 85+ year age group. In other minority groups, including Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Black, and Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, younger age groups had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths, 50-64 years, 65-74 years, and 50-64 years, respectively. These trends could reflect the health disparities that were exacerbated during the pandemic. For most of the age groups, there have been more COVID-19 deaths in males compared to females. In the oldest age group (85+ years), more women have died from COVID-19 than men. Studies have suggested that there is an association between COVID-19 outcomes and morbidity by sex. These gender differences could potentially be related to the incidence of COVID-19 comorbidities in men and women. Overall, COVID-19 mortality increases with age and there are sex differences in COVID-19 deaths.&quot;</code></pre>
